# Pokémon CRUD

### Learning Objectives
- Explain and use the Fetch API to consume data from an API and update the DOM
- Explain and apply the CRUD pattern in a simple frontend app

### Quickstart
- Fork and clone this repository to your local machine.
- Open `index.html` in LiveServer

### Standard Criteria

Use [this Pokémon REST API](https://boolean-uk-api-server.fly.dev/api-docs/#/pokemon) for all data. The URL is structured like this: `https://boolean-api-server.fly.dev/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/pokemon` (replace YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME with your github username)

- Show all existing pokemon when the page loads.
- Enable creating new pokemon when submitting the form. The list of pokemon should update on the screen without reloading the page.

### Extensions

1. Allow deleting a pokemon.
2. Allow updating a pokemon.
3. Add a "like" button to the pokemon, with a visual representation on screen that shows whether a pokemon has been liked or not.
